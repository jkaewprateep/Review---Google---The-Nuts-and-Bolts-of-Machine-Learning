Review - Google - The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning

🧸💬 Google has launched interesting courses in many areas including machine learning and AI to work applications. Seeking significant value responses and determining suitable dependent values is an important task. Sometime before training with the Gradient descent method, input parameters are limited by the input method in some cases. That is because relative values look easy to control in the starting and working as device control they need to be carefully selected. Sample the automatic machine safety of the bus door.
